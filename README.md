### DARKMINE

A 2D, top-down mining roguelike inspired by old Pokémon visuals. You start in a dark mine where most tiles are hidden. You can mine in any direction, but you rarely know what’s next. Occasionally, light reveals nearby tiles — safety, loot, or danger.

Every block mined is a gamble: ore, boosts, tools, traps, or nothing. Progress makes your character stronger (speed, mining power, vision range, immunities). Runs are short, tense, and replayable.

Multiplayer layers add choice: collaborate to clear deeper zones and share light, or fight over rare veins and exits. Trust is optional.

Economy
 • In-game resources: coal (energy), ore (crafting), diamonds (rare, high-risk zones).
 • Project token: used for permanent upgrades, cosmetics, access to deeper mines.
 • Optional twist: ore is a themed wrapper over an existing token (e.g. ORE), making mining feel “real” without forcing speculation.

Core hook
Darkness + randomness + permanent progression. Every swing could make you richer, stronger — or dead.
